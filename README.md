# Parkour Prototype

Very simple Parkour Prototype made in UE4.24 to test movement mechanics and animations. Very focused on player feeling.

Everything is developed in pure C++ (almost no blueprints used) and no Unreal initial template has been used.

***Controls***
- WASD for Movement
- Ctrl + W for Sliding
- Space Bar for Jumping
- Shift + W for Sprint (consumes Stamina)

Red objects hurt the character
Green ones recover HP
